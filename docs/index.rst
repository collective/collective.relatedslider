Install the add-on from the add-ons control panel, and then use the "Dexterity
Types" control panel to add the "Related Slider" behavior to your types.  Any
types using this behavior will also need to have either the "Related Items"
behavior or the "Collection" behavior applied as well.

When editing content with the behavior applied you should see a drop down to
select where the slider items come from (either collection criteria or related
items, depending on the applied behaviors).  If you use Related Items as the
source for slider items, the normal related items viewlet will be hidden from
view.
